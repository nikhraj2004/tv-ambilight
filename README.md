**Android TV Ambient Lighting Project ðŸŒˆðŸ“º**
This project syncs ambient lighting with an Android TV screen, creating a dynamic visual experience that adapts to whatâ€™s on the display. It uses an Arduino Uno, WS2812B LED strips, and AC to DC Power Converters to deliver real-time, color-matching ambient light effects for movies, games, and more!

Features
Dynamic Ambient Lighting: Matches LED colors to the content displayed on the Android TV screen.
Customizable: Modify colors, brightness, and animations through the code.
User-Friendly Setup: Control the lights with the companion app.
Components Used
WS2812B LED Strip: Provides the color-changing backlight.
Arduino Uno: Controls the LED strip and handles color data.
AC to DC Power Converter: Powers the LED strip and Arduino safely.
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Arduino and LED setup.
Familiarity with Android and GitHub (for downloading the app and accessing the code).
Installation
Hardware Setup
Connect the WS2812B LED strip to the Arduino Uno following the wiring guide:
Data Pin: Connect to a PWM pin on the Arduino (e.g., Pin 6).
Power: Connect the LED strip's power and ground to an AC to DC Power Converter compatible with the strip's requirements.
Ensure all connections are secure and the power supply meets the LED stripâ€™s voltage and current needs.
Software Setup
Arduino Code:
Download and install the FastLED library to control the LEDs.
Upload the Arduino code (ambient_light_control.ino) to the Arduino Uno.
Android App:
Download the Android Ambilight App from the Google Play Store.
Syncing with the App:
Pair the app with the Arduino to control and customize lighting effects.
Usage
Place the LED strip behind the TV for optimal backlighting.
Run the app and start syncing with your display.
Adjust settings such as brightness, color, and patterns directly from the app.
Project in Action
For a video demo and example photos, see the project repository or view sample visuals on the app's page.

Troubleshooting
No response from LEDs: Double-check wiring, especially the data pin.
Power issues: Ensure the power converter matches the voltage requirements of the LED strip.
Lag or delay: Adjust the app settings to improve sync speed.
